Using hybridauth with yii-user-management:

0.) Read the Hybrid Auth User Guide to get an idea of what we are doing here:
http://hybridauth.sourceforge.net/userguide.html

1.) Configure 'loginType' in UserModule configuration to include 'hybridauth' in your
application config/main.php. For example, set 'loginType' to 7, to allow login by
username, email and hybridauth. Make sure to enable the profile submodule.

2.) Select the providers you want to use in the 'hybridAuthProviders' array. For example,
to use Facebook and Twitter, set this variable to array('Facebook', 'Twitter')

3.) Take the modules/user/vendors/index.php, rename it to 'hybridauth.php' and place it 
beside your application index.php bootstrap script. This will be your hybrid auth
entry script. 

4.) Configure and place your hybridauth configuration file. Set the base_url
to the hybridauth.php script configured above. 

5.) Place the hybrid auth configuration file into your application
protected/config/hybridauth.php. If necessary, this path can be configured with 
the hybridAuthConfigFile option. You can use the example provided by 
hybridauth in user/vendors/hybridauth/config.php to get started. 

6.) Navigate to your login page. The configured providers should appear beneath
the login fields.
